                Hi there, you made it!  I hope it wasn't too hard to get here.  Did the person that directed you here give you the relative path or a direct path (coding reference)?  Well... alright! You're probably wondering where HERE is, what THIS is... let me answer those questions for you. Right NOW!
            </p>
            <p>You are here because you are looking for the best web developer (pssstt -- I am talking about me üòè ) and this is my website. Feel free to browse around. </p>
            <p>If you want to see what I am made of... I recommend checking out the "Portfolio" section. It's really cool and I worked my tail off.</p>
            <p>If you like what you see, go to the "Contact" section and drop me a line. I would be happy to help out on some website or develop an app for you.  HAVE FUN and I will chat with you later!!!</p>
